“不闻不若闻之，
闻之不若见之，
见之不若知之，
知之不若行之；
学之于行之而止矣。”

— 荀子

*"Not hearing is unlike hearing, 
hearing is unlike seeing, 
seeing is unlike knowing,
knowing is unlike doing;
learning is only achieved through doing."*

*\-Xunzi*

This project is dedicated to the memory of my elders. Their kindness, legacy and connection to their Chinese heritage inspired the creation of this tool. May this work bring learning and joy to others as a small tribute to your story.

With deepest respect,
